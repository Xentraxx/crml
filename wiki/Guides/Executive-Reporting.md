# Executive reporting

This guide focuses on how to communicate CRML simulation outputs.

## Common measures

- **EAL**: expected annual loss (mean)
- **VaR 95% / 99% / 99.9%**: tail percentiles

These are available in the reference engine’s `SimulationResult.metrics`.

See: [Engine capabilities: Results](../Engine/Capabilities/Results.md)

## Portfolio rollups

Portfolios allow you to report across multiple scenarios and exposures.
