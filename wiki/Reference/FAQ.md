# FAQ

## Is CRML a single “model file” format?

No. In this repo CRML is **document-oriented** (scenarios, portfolios, catalogs, assessments, bundles).

See: [CRML Specification (Overview)](CRML-Specification.md)

## Where is the simulation CLI?

Install `crml-engine` to get the `crml` CLI.

See: [Engine CLI](../Engine/CLI.md)

## Which frequency/severity models are supported?

Model support is engine-defined.

See: [Engine capabilities: Supported models](../Engine/Capabilities/Supported-Models.md)

## Does the reference engine support MCMC?

Not today. The Concepts page explains what MCMC is and how it would fit.

See: [Runtime (MCMC)](../Concepts/Runtime-MCMC.md)
