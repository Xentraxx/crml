scenario:
  frequency:
    basis: per_organization_per_year
    model: poisson
    parameters:
      lambda: 0.15  # 15% annual probability without controls
  
  severity:
    model: lognormal
    parameters:
      median: "700 000"  # $700K median ransomware payment + recovery
      currency: USD
      sigma: 1.8         # High variability in ransomware costs

# Expected Results:
# ================
# Without controls: Lambda = 0.15 (15% annual probability)
# With controls:    Lambda ≈ 0.0058 (0.58% annual probability)
# Risk reduction:   ≈ 96.1%
#
# Control effectiveness breakdown:
# - Email filtering:     90% × 100% × 95% = 85.5% reduction
# - Security awareness:  60% × 95% × 90% = 51.3% reduction  
# - EDR:                 80% × 98% × 92% = 72.1% reduction
# - App whitelisting:    85% × 90% × 95% = 72.7% reduction
# - Network segmentation: 70% × 85% × 99% = 58.9% reduction
# - Immutable backups:   95% × 98% × 99% = 92.2% reduction
#
# Combined (defense in depth):
# P(breach) = 0.15 × (1-0.855) × (1-0.513) × (1-0.721) × (1-0.727) × (1-0.589) × (1-0.922)
#           ≈ 0.0058 (0.58%)
#
# Total control cost: $390,000/year
# Risk reduction: ~$105K in expected losses (if EAL baseline ≈ $105K)
# ROI depends on baseline EAL
