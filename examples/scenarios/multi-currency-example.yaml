    Multinational PII compliance risk model for a company operating in both
    the EU (Germany) and US (California).
    
    This model captures two distinct regulatory risks:
    - GDPR violations in Germany (fines in EUR)
    - CCPA violations in California (fines in USD)
    
    Use with --fx-config to normalize currencies for consolidated reporting:
